			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

Inside struct thread, there are two new elements:

     struct list_elem sleep_elem;        /*!< List element for sleeping threads list. */
     int64_t sleep_end;                  /*!< For sleeping thread, time of sleep end. */

As explained in the comment, the first is the element for the sleeping threads list (as
required by that list), and the second is the time that the thread should stop sleeping.

I also created two new functions (thread_sleep and thread_wake) and changed thread_tick 
to take the current total number of ticks. The thread_wake function loops through all the 
threads on the sleeping threads list and wakes them if the global ticks is greater than the 
threads sleep_end variable. The thread_sleep function pushes the thread onto the sleeping
threads list and sets the thread's sleep_end variable.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

When timer_sleep() is called, interrupts are disabled. Then, thread_sleep() is called
with the end time (which is current time + number of ticks to sleep). That function
sets the thread's sleep_end variable and pushes it onto the sleeping threads list.
Then, timer_sleep() calls thread_block(). After it returns (i.e. the thread is
unblocked) the interrupt level is set to what it was before.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

Looping over only the sleeping threads as opposed to all threads. Only doing some 
basic list/unblocking operations.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

Interrupts are disabled before anything is done with the sleeping threads list (including
asserting that they are before the list is directly touched in thread_sleep). 

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

Interrupts are disabled right before thread_sleep is called. Therefore, the only time an
interrupt can be called inside timer_sleep() is right after we load the current 
timer_ticks(). However, this is okay, because we'd like to know the timer_ticks from
when timer_sleep() is called, not the current time (otherwise we might sleep too long!)

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

This seems the most straightforward design for this. The only simple way that I could think
of changing this is looping through all threads instead of the sleeping threads, but that
makes it take longer inside the timer interrupt handler.

Oh my goodness...

In thread.h, inside the thread struct:

    int mlfq_priority;                  /*!< Priority for mlfq -- separated
                                             variable to avoid possible
                                             conflicts. */
    int nice;                           /*!< Thread niceness for mlfq. */
    int recent_cpu;                     /*!< Thread recent_cpu in 17.14
                                             fixed point arithmetic */

These are to keep the values as needed by the priority calculation.

In thread.c, in the global space:

int f = 1 << 14; // For fixed point arithmetic
// System load average in 17.14 fixed point number representation.
static int load_avg;

static bool thread_inited = false;

The last one of these is to make sure calculations don't happen until
the threading system is initialized.

This doesn't specify when the scheduler was called. My code will
run the scheduler when a thread uses up its time slice or
yields/blocks/etc. In the table above, I rescheduled the currently
running thread whenever a different thread got a higher priority. 
In practice, I think this uses a lot of time overhead though (checking
for higher priority threads) so I just let the thread use up its
time slice.

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code

There is a lot of updating of every-thread stuff going on with interrupts
disabled, so this could cause performance issues.

I guess my design works. That is a pretty big advantage. It is also
pretty much the most straightforward implementation, so I imagine
it must be pretty easy to understand what it does.

I guess if I had more time I could work a little more on doing fewer
things with interrupts disabled and inside interrupt contexts.

I just did it directly, because it was the most straightforward way
to do it. Implementing a library might have made the code more readable
but I only had to use fixed-point arithmetic in like three functions
so it didn't seem that worth it. By the time the thought even came
to me to do it the other way, I had already written those functions :O

alarm_clock is fine ~Ilya
